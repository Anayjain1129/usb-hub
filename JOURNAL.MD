## 5th July:
>I have a laptop so like I really need some more ports then, the highway came up and I thought I can make a usb-hub.
>I spent 3hours for researching and browsing the yt tuuts and all and making a basic layout on paper and how many ports should I put in it. Cannot upload the paper's photo cause I don't have phone. ğŸ˜­

## 1st Hour: Making sch
>At first I tried to find and import the library, so what i tried was to export all of the parts to a KiCAD library, but I could not find the footprints for the Usb-ports and all, so I continued with EasyEDA.
>It wasn't actually my first time using EasyEDA So yea I wasn't completely new to EasyEDA.
